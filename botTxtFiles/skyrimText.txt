Let me guess... someone stole your sweetroll.
Citizen.
Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me.
What do you need?
Trouble?
What is it?
No lollygaggin'.
Staying safe I hope.
Everything all right?
Could sure use a warm bed right about now...
I'd be a lot warmer and a lot happier with a bellyful of mead...
I mostly deal with petty thievery and drunken brawls. Been too long since we've had a good bandit raid.
What is it? Dragons?
Watch the skies, traveler.
My cousin's out fighting dragons, and what do I get? Guard duty.
Gotta keep my eyes open. Damn dragons could swoop down at any time.
Fear not. Come dragon or giant, we'll be ready.
They say Ulfric Stormcloak murdered the High King... with his voice! Shouted him apart!
No matter what else happens, the guards will always be grateful for everything you've done.
Yes, Dovahkiin? How can I help you?
Whatever you need, Dragonborn. Just say the word.
Helgen... destroyed by a dragon. Hard to believe, isn't it?
I fear the night. Because the werewolves and vampires don't.
Bit late to be wandering around, isn't it?
Only burglars and vampires creep around after dark. So which are you?
You hear that? I swear, there's something out there. In the dark.
I hope you're finding the city in proper order, thane.
I trust the day's found you well, thane.
How do you do, thane?
They say Helgen got hit by a dragon. One of those horrors comes here, we'll be ready.
Brigands I can handle, but this talk of dragons? World's gone mad, I say.
Everything's in order.
Just a few more hours and I can crawl under some furs...
Jarl's been looking for someone who ain't superstitious though. Be lookin' for a fool if you ask me.
It's bad luck to talk about that place.
You should talk to the Jarl up in Dragonsreach, lend any aid you can.
Stormcloaks, Imperials, dragons. Ain't no matter to me what I kill. Let them come.
